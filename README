NAME

Scalar::Construct - build custom kinds of scalar

DESCRIPTION

This module supplies functions to construct Perl scalar objects.
While writable (variable) scalars can easily be constructed using the
ordinary facilities of the Perl language, immutable (constant) scalars
require a library such as this.

INSTALLATION

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install
